### Main technique：<br />
HTML, JS and CSS

### Library:<br />
JavaScript library ‘Mapbox GL JS’

### Main Function:<br />
#### · ① Filter: <br />
**Description:  <br />**
Choose the type of HDB block by sliding. Select the area by clicking. These two filters could work at the same time.<br />
**Coding ideas: <br />**
get input → conditional statements (if/else) & logical  statements(==/!=)<br />
First get the user's input, that is, where the user dragged the slider or clicked the button, and then set up a series of conditional statements containing logical  statements  to make the map change based on user's input.<br />
<br />

#### · ② Layer controller:  <br />
**Description: <br />**
Show layers/hide layers with the click of a button for a clear view of the different features.<br />
**Coding ideas: <br />**
click event → overwrite ‘visibility’ property<br />
In mapbox GL JS, the layer have a property called ‘visibility’, and all we need to do is to overwrite this property once the user's click event happens.<br />
<br />

#### · ③ Legend of carbon emissions:  <br />
**Description:  <br />**
The green and blue color represents a smaller index of carbon emissions, while the purple color represents a larger index of carbon emissions for the block.<br />
**Coding ideas:  <br />**
This is achieved by the layout and background color of 'div'.<br />
